# Formula-CV

# Object Detection = identifying multiple objects per image, and then determine their locations and classify them

# The naive approach to doing this is to scan an image with a sliding window and feed every part of this image to a classifier. This process is very slow and will never be used for real time cases. An improved version foer this idea is the Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN), which strategically selects regions to run through the classifier.
